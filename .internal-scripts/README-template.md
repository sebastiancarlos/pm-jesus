## Introduction
> Jesus told his disciples: â€œThere was a rich man whose **manager** was accused
> of wasting his possessions."
- Luke 16:1

Be like that man, and don't let your multiple package manager take all your
time! Build your own cross-platform scripts, or use these!

**Disclaimer:** These scripts are for my personal use, written in a way that makes sense to me. I only open-sourced them as a joke and as an example of how reinventing your own wheel is not that hard sometimes, and comes with the benefit of doing just what you need it to do. For a more complete solution, check [sysget](https://github.com/emilengler/sysget) or [app](https://github.com/hkdb/app).

## Installation

Grab your favorite shell and get going:

1. `git clone https://github.com/sebastiancarlos/pm-jesus`
2. `cd pm-jesus`
3. `./pm-install vim` (as you should)

Optionally add to your `PATH`. (This can be done by running `make install`)

## Commandments

Every command comes with its own help message. Just type `--help` after the
command to get a detailed explanation of its usage.

The commands are:

<!-- INSERT commands_help -->
## Known Limitations

Currently, only Pacman and Homebrew are supported. One because I have to work,
the other because I'm based. Guess which is which.
