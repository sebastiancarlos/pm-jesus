\*that matters to me; currently Pacman and Homebrew (but my ~~DMs~~
PRs are open!)

## Introduction
> Jesus told his disciples: â€œThere was a rich man whose **manager** was accused
> of wasting his possessions."
- Luke 16:1

Be like that man, and don't let your multiple package manager take all your
time! Build your own cross-platform scripts, or use these!

## Installation

Grab your favorite shell and get going:

1. `git clone https://github.com/sebastiancarlos/pm-jesus`
2. `cd pm-jesus`
3. `./pm-install vim` (as you should)

Optionally add to your `PATH`. (This can be done by running `make install`)

## Known Limitations

Currently, only Pacman and Homebrew are supported. One because I have to work,
the other because I'm based. Guess which is which.
